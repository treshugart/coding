# Linked lists

The simplest form of linked lists is called a "singly linked list". A singly
linked list is a series of nodes where each individual node contains both a
value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

With linked lists, you can:

- Add to the _end_ of the list.
- Remove an item from the list.
- Reverse the list.
- Search the list.

With a doubly-linked list, you can do all of the above but each item also
contains a pointer that refers to the previous item in the list.
